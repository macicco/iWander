# iWander
Dynamics of Interstellar Wanderers

Presentation
------------

This package is an implementation of the general method devised by
Zuluaga,Sánchez-Hernández & Sucerquia (2017) for assesing the
procedence of interstellar small bodies (asteroids and comets).

The package include a series of databases and tools that can be used
in general for studying the the dynamics of an interstellar vagabond
object (small-body, interstellar spaceship and even stars).

If you use or adapt the package for any scientific purpose please
refer to [this paper](http://arxiv.org):
