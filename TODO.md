iWander
=================

To Do list
------------

* Update galactic parameters from Karim & Mamajek (2016). 

* Check galactic pole rotation.

* Check compilation in Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.

* Purge iwander.cpp.

* Perform tests on the method.

* Include probability of being ejected from a star in the same region
  of the volume occupied by the cloud of surrogate objects.

* Include in the probabilituy, velocity direction probability.

* Include an estimation in the number and mass of objects ejected from
  a progenitor star.

* Compute sensitivity of the method to varying parameters of the
  Galaxy.

* Create an animation with the most important candidates.

* Make scripts to generate key plots of the reconstructed path of the
  object

* Forward integration.

* Include the name of the object in the outputfiles.

* Create configuration files depending on wanderer.

* Allow calculations for objects with zero uncertainty in orbital
  elements.

Done
------------

* Publish the list of progenitor candidates.
